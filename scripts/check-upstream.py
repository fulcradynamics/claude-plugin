"""Report what changed upstream since the skills here were adapted.

The contact skills are adapted from the ChatGPT Fulcra plugin
(fulcradynamics/fulcra-openai-plugin). provenance.json records, for each file,
its source path and the sha256 of the source content it was adapted from.
Adapted files are rewritten for Claude, so they are never copied over; this
lists which sources changed so someone can port the changes by hand. Verbatim
files must match their source exactly.

Comparisons use those content hashes, not git history, so they work even
though the recorded commit may not exist in the checkout (the plugin's history
was rewritten when it moved repositories).

    scripts/check-upstream.py <ChatGPT plugin checkout>             # its origin/main
    scripts/check-upstream.py <ChatGPT plugin checkout> <ref>       # another ref
    scripts/check-upstream.py <ChatGPT plugin checkout> <ref> --repin   # after porting

Upstream skill files that nothing here comes from are reported too, unless
provenance.json lists them under "ignored_upstream" with the reason.

Exits 0 when nothing changed and every check passes, 1 otherwise. --repin
records <ref> and the current content hash of every source.
